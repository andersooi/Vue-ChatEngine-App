# Vue ChatEngine App
 
Vue ChatEngine App is a scalable, serverless chat application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Realtime Chat**: The app allows users to chat with one another in realtime once they are signed in. 
- **Serverless**: The app utilises ChatEngine.io that handles all the backend for us, as well as allowing seamless integration of chat functionality. 


## 🛠️ Technologies

- `Vue.js`
- `Vite.js`
- `ChatEngine.io`
- `Axios`
- `JavaScript`
- `Veaury`

## 📝 How It Works

Once users have signed up for an account, they can easily start chats with other users that are registered on the app just like any other chat application.
